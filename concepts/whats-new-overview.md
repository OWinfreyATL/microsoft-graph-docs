# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.


## April 2023: New and generally available

### Device and app management | Browser management
Administrators can use the [Edge API in Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/resources/browser-edge-api-overview) in an app to manage an organization's browser site lists for Internet Explorer (IE) mode that reside in the cloud, much like the way they can do it in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). With proper permissions, the app can create a [browser site list](/graph/api/resources/browsersitelist), add a [browser site](/graph/api/resources/browsersite) and [shared cookie](/graph/api/resources/browsersharedcookie), and [publish](/graph/api/browsersitelist-publish) the site list for Microsoft Edge to download.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
Include an [authentication strength policy](/graph/api/resources/authenticationstrengthpolicy) as part of [conditonal access grant controls](/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccessgrantcontrols) to be fulfilled to pass a [conditional access policy](/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy). An authentication strength policy defines specific combinations of authentication methods to be used to authenticate in the corresponding scenario.

### Search | Query
Qualify a [search query](/graph/api/resources/searchquery) string with a query template, which supports KQL and query variables.

### Teamwork and communications | Calls and online meetings
Specify whether content for an [online meeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting), such as shared content or video feed, should have [watermark protection](/graph/api/resources/watermarkprotectionvalues). To support watermarking content, client applications must implement and apply the watermarking.

### Teamwork and communications | Messaging
Subscribe to change notifications in a tenant where a specific Teams app is installed, for the following resources:
- [Any message in any chat](/graph/teams-changenotifications-chatmessage#subscribe-to-messages-of-any-chat-in-a-tenant-where-a-specific-teams-app-is-installed)
- [Any chat](/graph/teams-changenotifications-chat#subscribe-to-changes-in-any-chat-in-a-tenant-where-a-teams-app-is-installed)
- [Membership of any chat](/graph/teams-changenotifications-chatmembership#subscribe-to-changes-in-membership-of-any-chat-in-a-tenant-where-a-teams-app-is-installed)
